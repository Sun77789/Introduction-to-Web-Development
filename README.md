## **Objective**

The purpose of this course is to provide a means to learn more about technology and specifically, the fundamentals for web development. Many students who have some previous background in front-end development or business development are curious about backend-development and what is involved in building an application. Rather than relying on other programmers to build your idea, these students are encouraged to learn by themselves. However, CS classes do not focus heavily on web development for non-CS students. Dev bootcamp classes are too expensive and intense for a general curiosity. And of course self-study can be a frustrating process that can stifle all of the fun. Thus, this class was born to provide students an opportunity to learn a new skill with the help of peers and student instructors as an introduction to application development.

This curriculum for this course is designed for two 60-minute classes each week for 9 weeks (1st to 9th week). Some programming background is recommended since the material will be covered briefly at a quick pace. The first session for the week will be more lecture-based while the second session for the week is more focused on student collaboration on practice exercises.

## **Attendance**

While this is not an official class and no grades or course credits are confererd, please make your best effort to be present and on time to each class.  There are unfortunately a limited number of seats in CSIL (20), and there is high demand to learn the basics of creating website and web applications.  Respect your peers, if you can't/won't make the class, please leave the spot for someone else to reserve.
