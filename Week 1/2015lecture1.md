##Web Dev, What is it?##

What is the web? It's a ton of servers yes, but really it's just a ton of computers and bits flying around in the air and on wires. The important thing for a web developer though, is not to understand how to construct packets (although we might get into that), but to understand the relationship between technologies and use them appropriately.

In this class we will be using a range of different technologies, using Ruby on Rails(henceforth RoR) as our control group, to explore different technologies, and hopefully build a multi-tiered application at the end of this class. At the very least we want to be able to say "I don't need X technology because Y does it already" and at some point say "this library does not provide X functionality but we can add it in." This class will be structured for all levels, and hopefully we can all learn something.
