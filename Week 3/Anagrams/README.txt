-------------- RUN GUIDELINES ----------------
anagram.rb						-run this with a file param
								Example: ruby anagram.rb words.txt

anagrams.txt 					- output file

-------------- END GUIDELINES ----------------

NOTES: There was some difficulty in thinking about how to sort by number of anagrams and then by the length of the word. the console output looks nice in the end.

Other notes. I wondered how many anagrams Voynich has based on the data I have, And I wonder if its proportions fit well with English. Do if time.
