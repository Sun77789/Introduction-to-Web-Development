So last time we did some stuff with routes. We saw that we needed three things, a model, a view and a controller.

We didn't really go over any of these at all, so lets do that finally:

**Controller:** a function that runs a piece of code. A function is an action is a definition. They are all the same thing. However if you say "action" you're probably referring to something that returns a view. They are however, defined the same.

**Model:** An object with properties. This is just a class like any other. However, the difference is that we have rails generate the class representation for the database rather than just creating it ourselves.

**View:** The HTML/CSS generated by the controller

So when we ask for the home page, Rails finds the controller that will give us back the view for the home page. Looking at the console we can see that the web page returned a default page. We want to get to a point where we can define our own pages.

We need three things for this: a controller, a view, and a route. A route tells Rails where to find the controller and the view.
